The site itself was made in a way that it can be dynamically updated without messing up the whole style of website. This is done by seperating the site into a few php pieces where each corresponds to a specific part of the website. Furthermore, the project contains information about the school and a functioning javascript gallery where a user can easily navigate and see the different pictures connected to the project and the school itself. While the website in itself doesnt have a grand idea behind it still reached the National Olympiad of 2016. </p></div>',2)),t("div",B,[e[7]||(e[7]=t("h1",null,"Pictures of The Project",-1)),t("div",G,[t("button",{class:"galleryButton",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=o=>s(0)),title:"Open Gallery"},[a(i,{src:"/images/Web1.jpg"})]),t("button",{class:"galleryButton",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=o=>s(1)),title:"Open Gallery"},[a(i,{src:"/images/Web2.jpg"})]),t("button",{class:"galleryButton",onClick:e[2]||(e[2]=o=>s(2)),title:"Open Gallery"},[a(i,{src:"/images/Web3.jpg"})]),t("button",{class:"galleryButton",onClick:e[3]||(e[3]=o=>s(3)),title:"Open Gallery"},[a(i,{src:"/images/Web4.jpg"})]),t("button",{class:"galleryButton",onClick:e[4]||(e[4]=o=>s(4)),title:"Open Gallery"},[a(i,{src:"/images/Web5.jpg"})]),t("button",{class:"galleryButton",onClick:e[5]||(e[5]=o=>s(5)),title:"Open Gallery"},[a(i,{src:"/images/Web7.jpg"})])]),a(w(k)),a(d,{to:"/myCV",class:"topBorder"},{default:_(()=>e[6]||(e[6]=[t("button",{class:"backButton",style:{"vertical-align":"middle"}},[t("span",null,"Back To CV ")],-1)])),_:1})])])}}}),L=j(O,[["__scopeId","data-v-38d557a7"]]);export{L as default};
