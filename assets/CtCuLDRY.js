The idea of this project was for a user to be able to press a button in front of a carwash, which then prompts a nearby camera to scan the license plate of the car from where it checks if the said user is subscribe to the carwash services and whether if he is or not it will either allow him to enter or to register. For this project I used a micro-controller titled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266" data-v-a9561716>ESP8266</a> and the linux system <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" data-v-a9561716>Raspberry Pi 3</a> and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT" data-v-a9561716> MQTT</a> brocker. The first thing I did for this project was set up the micro-controller so that it can be subscribe to a specific MQTT topic and also publish in the same topic. This way it can activate the whole system that is managed by the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" data-v-a9561716>Raspberry Pi 3</a> and do a specific task when a specific command is published. Here is the code for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266" data-v-a9561716>ESP8266</a> I wrote: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Bq8VF9iS_GbyS3mcePZTm_2CcGT9WBDI/view?usp=sharing" data-v-a9561716>Code</a>. </p><p data-v-a9561716> Afterwards I wrote the code for the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" data-v-a9561716>Raspberry Pi 3</a> that enables the linux system to be able to be subscribe to the same <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT" data-v-a9561716> MQTT</a> brocker as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266" data-v-a9561716>ESP8266</a> and to publish there too. That allows it to give specific commands to the micro-controller and also know when to start the checking proccess. The proccess itself consits of taking a picture of the license plate and then sending it to the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/" data-v-a9561716>Google Vision API</a>, which gives back the letters and numbers of the plate. From there the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" data-v-a9561716>Raspberry Pi 3</a> checks to see if the data is in the IoT Database (<a href="https://cloud.google.com/sql/" data-v-a9561716>Google Database</a>) and then depending on whether the users in the database or not the linux system sends a specifc command to the micro-controller. Furthermore, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266" data-v-a9561716>ESP8266</a> then either shines a green LED and then allows the user to enter or shines a red LED and then prompts the user to register.
